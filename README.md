This is my site. 
There are many like it, but this one is mine. 
My site is my best friend. 
It is my life. 
I must master it as I master my life. 
My site, without me, is useless. 
Without my site, I am useless. 
I must fire my site true. 
I must shoot straighter than any enemy who is trying to kill me. 
I must shoot him before he shoots me. 
I will... 
My site and myself know that what counts in this war is not the rounds we fire, the noise of our burst, nor the smoke we make. 
We know that it is the hits that count. 
We will hit... 
My site is human, even as I, because it is my life. 
Thus, I will learn it as a brother. 
I will learn its weakness, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its sights and its barrel. 
I will keep my site clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. 
We will become part of each other. 
We will.... 
Before God I swear this creed. 
My site and myself are the defenders of my country. 
We are the masters of our enemy. 
We are the saviors of my life. 
So be it, until victory is America's and there is no enemy, but Peace.
